1.0.8

Added demand system (old code is still there in case it doesn't work out as well as we thought)
Market GUI now updates according to current demand

1.0.7

Rewrote completeRecipe method to allow for output overflow
Fixed a bug that emerged that caused the input to be consumed if its size wasn't greater than the variation
(This emerged from isDataMapEqual evaluating to true if the input count was less than or equal to the variation,
which in turn caused the old isDataMapEqual check to run completeRecipe when it shouldn't if the input test returned false)
Removed canInsertItemIntoOutputSlot and hasOutputSpace (they were doing the same thing anyway?)

1.0.6

Removed market order timer, orders now stay until completed or the license expires
Removed market cooldown
Changed license damaging to be every X ticks (config to come), rather than on recipe completion
Orders now vanish if the license item is removed
Market GUI no longer shows time remaining or cooldown text
Removed unused hasLicense method from MarketBlockEntity
Extracted recipe completion logic into its own method completeRecipe, saves it being repeated with only a tiny change
Added a new test recipe with a diamond sword as the license
Cleaned up the use of currentRecipe and recipeID in MarketBlockEntity (now get set to null when not in use)

1.0.6

Fixed the market allowing basically any amount of items to be valid for the recipe
Fixed the market not applying the correct count in the output (this was a bug from the nbt .applyComponents() method)

1.0.5

fixed client world sync issue with the market saving int values
tweaked the recipe class to use a new method for syncing the recipes from server to the client
merged changes

1.0.4

Tweaked recipes
    input is now optional if you need specific items with components use "inputWithNbt"

Example: This will only accept water bottles as input

  "inputWithNbt": {
    "components": {
      "minecraft:potion_contents": {
        "potion": "minecraft:water"
      }
    },
    "count": 1,
    "id": "minecraft:potion"
  }

Allows for almost any item to be used as an input in whatever configuration you want
Fully works with the the other recipes as well, just acts like an additional recipe
Added to JEI and the screen render
DataComponents now work on output items as well same as the new inputWithNbt way
see nbt_test_10.json for an example of this
