Tweaked recipes
    input is now optional if you need specific items with components use "inputWithNbt"

Example: This will only accept water bottles as input

  "inputWithNbt": {
    "components": {
      "minecraft:potion_contents": {
        "potion": "minecraft:water"
      }
    },
    "count": 1,
    "id": "minecraft:potion"
  }

Allows for almost any item to be used as an input in whatever configuration you want
Fully works with the the other recipes as well, just acts like an additional recipe
Added to JEI and the screen render
